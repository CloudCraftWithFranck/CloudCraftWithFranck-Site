It offers tools for collaboration, a platform for showcasing your work, and a history of changes to help track progress and identify issues. With millions of repositories hosted, GitHub is a hub for innovation and learning.

## Step 2: Install Git

GitHub is built on Git, a distributed version control system. To manage your projects locally, you’ll need to install Git on your computer.

1. Visit the [official Git site](https://git-scm.com/) and download the installer for your operating system.
2. Run the installer and follow the setup prompts:
   - Select default options unless you have specific requirements.
3. Once installed, open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
4. Configure your username and email address:
  
<CodeBlock
    className="custom-code-block"
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"`,
            label: "Git Configuration",
            language: "bash",
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
    style={{
        backgroundColor: "#1e1e1e",
        borderRadius: "8px",
        padding: "16px",
        color: "#dcdcdc",
    }}
/>
   These details will be associated with your commits.

Now Git is ready to work with GitHub.

## Step 3: Create Your First Repository

A repository, or "repo," is where your project files are stored on GitHub.

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Click the **New** button in the upper-left corner or go to [Create Repository](https://github.com/new).
3. Enter a name for your repository. For example, `my-first-repo`.
4. Optionally, add a description to explain the purpose of the repository.
5. Choose visibility:
   - **Public:** Anyone can see your repository.
   - **Private:** Only you and invited collaborators can access it.
6. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**. This file provides a brief overview of your project.
7. Click **Create Repository**.

You’ve successfully created your first GitHub repository!

## Step 4: Clone Your Repository

To work on your project locally, you need to clone the repository to your computer.

1. Open the repository page on GitHub.
2. Click the green **Code** button and copy the HTTPS link.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to save the repository.
4. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <URL>
   ```
   Replace `<URL>` with the link you copied.

Your repository is now downloaded to your local machine.

## Step 5: Make Changes and Push to GitHub

After cloning your repository, you can start adding files and making changes.

1. Navigate to the cloned repository folder on your computer.
2. Add or modify files. For instance, create a file named `hello-world.txt` and add some content to it.
3. Use the following commands to save your changes:
   - Stage the changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Added hello-world.txt"
     ```
   - Push the changes to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

Check your GitHub repository to see the updated files.

## Step 6: Explore Collaboration Features

GitHub is more than just a version control tool—it’s a collaboration powerhouse. Here are some features to explore:

- **Pull Requests:** Submit changes for review before merging them into the main project.
- **Issues:** Report bugs, suggest features, or track tasks within a repository.
- **Branches:** Create separate branches for new features or bug fixes without affecting the main branch.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automate tasks like testing, deployment, and notifications with workflows.

These tools make teamwork efficient and transparent.
